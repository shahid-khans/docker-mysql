## 🚀 Goal

**Quick and easiest way to setup mysql database using docker.**

[install docker & docker-compose]: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker



> after installing the docker and docker-compose follow the below 3 steps and that's it.
>
> 1. ☑ **clone the repository**
> 2. **☑ run the ./start.sh** 
> 3. **☑ enjoy !**



## 🎯Quick Start

Just open in a terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shahid-khans/docker-mysql.git
cd docker-mysql
cp env-example .env
./start.sh
```

Open database editor tool my favorite ♥️️  is  [heidisql only for windows](https://www.heidisql.com/)

You can check the logs using `./logs.sh` command to see what's going on during the project startup.

you can stop the  mysql docker container using `./stop.sh`
default port for mysql is `3306` and credentials you can see in `.env` file.
